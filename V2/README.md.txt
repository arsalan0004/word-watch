Description: 
This version of the word watch changed the organization of the LEDs so that 
less wiring would be required to charlieplex them together. This decrease 
in wiring decreases the number of vias required for the design. Because
there are fewer vias, there is enough space to add a battery holder to 
run the circuit. This design should also theoretically suffer from less 
parasitic capacitance issues becuase there are fewer vias. This circuit 
also features wider traces, which are not strictly necessary, but are good 
practice for designing circuits.
